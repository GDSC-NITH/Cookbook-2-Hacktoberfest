# Time Complexity

## Introduction

An important question while programming is: How efficient is an algorithm or piece
of code?
Efficiency covers lots of resources, including:

- CPU (time) usage
- memory usage
- disk usage
- network usage

All are important but we are mostly concerned about CPU time.
Be careful to differentiate between:

### 1. Performance

how much time/memory/disk/etc. is actually used when a
program is run. This depends on the machine, compiler, etc. as well as the code we
write.

### 2. Complexity

how do the resource requirements of a program or algorithm scale,
i.e. what happens as the size of the problem being solved by the code gets larger.
Complexity affects performance but not vice-versa.
The time required by a function/method is proportional to the number of "basic
operations" that it performs.

#### Here are some examples of basic operations

- one arithmetic operation (e.g. a+b / a\*b)
- one assignment (e.g. int x = 5)
- one condition/test (e.g. x == 0)
- one input read (e.g. reading a variable from console)
- one output write (e.g. writing a variable on console)

Some functions/methods perform the same number of operations every time they
are called.

For example, the size function/method of the string class always performs just one
operation: return number of Items; the number of operations is independent of the
size of the string. We say that functions/methods like this (that always perform a
fixed number of basic operations) require constant time.

Other functions/methods may perform different numbers of operations,
depending on the value of a parameter. For example, for the array implementation
of the Vector/list(Java) class(vector/list classes are implemented similar to the
dynamic class we have built), the remove function/method has to move over all of
the items that were to the right of the item that was removed (to fill in the gap).
The number of moves depends both on the position of the removed item and the
number of items in the list. We call the important factors (the parameters and/or
fields whose values affect the number of operations performed) the problem size
or the input size.

When we consider the complexity of a function/method, we don't really care about
the exact number of operations that are performed; instead, we care about how
the number of operations relates to the problem size. If the problem size doubles,
does the number of operations stay the same? double? increase in some other
way? For constant-time functions/methods like the size function/method, doubling
the problem size does not affect the number of operations (which stays the same).

Furthermore, we are usually interested in the worst case: what is the most
operations that might be performed for a given problem size. For example, as
discussed above, the remove function/method has to move all of the items that
come after the removed item one place to the left in the array. In the worst case,
all of the items in the array must be moved. Therefore, in the worst case, the time
for remove is proportional to the number of items in the list, and we say that the
worst-case time for remove is linear to the number of items in the array. For a
linear-time function/method, if the problem size doubles, the number of
operations also doubles.

## Big-O Notation

We express complexity using big-O notation. For a problem of size N:

- a constant-time function/method is "order 1": O(1)
- a linear-time function/method is "order N": O(N)
- a quadratic-time function/method is "order N squared": O(N")

Note that the big-O expressions do not have constants or low-order terms. This is
because, when N gets large enough, constants and low-order terms don't matter
(a constant-time function/method will be faster than a linear-time
function/method, which will be faster than a quadratic-time function/method).

#### See below for an example.

Formal definition:

A function T(N) is O(F(N)) if for some constant c and for all values of N greater than
some value n :

T(N) <= c \* F(N)

The idea is that T(N) is the exact complexity of a function/method or algorithm as a function of the problem size N, and that F(N) is an upper-bound on that
complexity (i.e. the actual time/space or whatever for a problem of size N will be no worse than F(N)).

In practice, we want the smallest F(N) - the least upper bound
on the actual complexity.

For example, consider T(N) = 3 _ N^2 + 5. We can show that T(N) is O(N^2) by choosing
c = 4 and n = 2. This is because for all values of N greater than 2:
3 _ N^2 + 5 <= 4 \* N^2

T(N) is not O(N), because whatever constant c and value n you choose, I can always
find a value of N greater than n so that 3 _ N^2 + 5 is greater than c _ N.

### How to Determine Complexities

In general, how can you determine the running time of a piece of code? The answer
is that it depends on what kinds of statements are used.

#### 1. Sequence of statements

```c
statement	1;
statement	2;
		...
statement	k;
```

The total time is found by adding the times for all statements:
total time = time(statement 1) + time(statement 2) + ... + time(statement k)
If each statement is "simple" (only involves basic operations) then the time for each
statement is constant and the total time is also constant: O(1). In the following
examples, assume the statements are simple unless noted otherwise.

#### 2. if-then-else statements

```c
if	(condition)	{
		sequence	of	statements	1
}
else	{
		sequence	of	statements	2
}
```

Here, either sequence 1 will execute, or sequence 2 will execute. Therefore, the
worst-case time is the slowest of the two possibilities: max(time(sequence 1),
time(sequence 2)). For example, if sequence 1 is O(N) and sequence 2 is O(1) the
worst-case time for the whole if-then-else statement would be O(N).

#### 3. for loops

```c
for	(i	=	0;	i	<	N;	i++)	{
	sequence	of	statements
}
```

The loop executes N times, so the sequence of statements also executes N times.
Since we assume the statements are O(1), the total time for the for loop is N \* O(1),
which is O(N) overall.

#### 4. Nested loops

First we'll consider loops where the number of iterations of the inner loop is
independent of the value of the outer loop's index. For example:

```c
for	(i	=	0;	i	<	N;	i++)	{
     for	(j	=	0;	j	<	M;	j++)	{
	    sequence	of	statements
}
}
```

The outer loop executes N times. Every time the outer loop executes, the inner loop
executes M times. As a result, the statements in the inner loop execute a total of N _ M times. Thus, the complexity is O(N _ M). In a common special case where the
stopping condition of the inner loop is j < N instead of j < M (i.e., the inner loop also
executes N times), the total complexity for the two loops is O(N").
Now let's consider nested loops where the number of iterations of the inner loop
depends on the value of the outer loop's index. For example:

```c
for	(i	=	0;	i	<	N;	i++)	{
	for	(j	=	i+1;	j	<	N;	j++)	{
		sequence	of	statements
	}
}
```

Now we can't just multiply the number of iterations of the outer loop times the
number of iterations of the inner loop, because the inner loop has a different
number of iterations each time. So let's think about how many iterations that inner
loop has. That information is given in the following table:
|Value of i|Number of iterations of inner loop|
|---|---|
|0|N|
|1| N-1|
|2 |N-2|
|...| ...|
|N-2 |2|
|N-1 |1|

So we can see that the total number of times the sequence of statements executes
is: N + N-1 + N-2 + ... + 3 + 2 + 1. the total is O(N").

#### 5. Statements with function/method calls:

When a statement involves a function/method call, the complexity of the
statement includes the complexity of the function/method call. Assume that you
know that function/method f takes constant time, and that function/method g
takes time proportional to (linear in) the value of its parameter k. Then the
statements below have the time complexities indicated.

```c
f(k); // O(1)
g(k); // O(k)
```

When a loop is involved, the same rule applies. For example:

```c
for (j = 0; j < N; j++) {
g(N);
}
```

has complexity (N^2). The loop executes N times and each function/method call g(N)
is complexity O(N).

### Best-case and Average-case Complexity

Some functions/methods may require different amounts of time on different calls,
even when the problem size is the same for both calls. For example, consider the
add function/method that adds an item to the end of the Vector/list. In the worst
case (the array is full), that function/method requires time proportional to the
number of items in the Vector/list (because it has to copy all of them into the new,
larger array). However, when the array is not full, add will only have to copy one
value into the array, so in that case its time is independent of the length of the
Vector/list; i.e. constant time.

In general, we may want to consider the best and average time requirements of a
function/method as well as its worst-case time requirements. Which is considered
the most important will depend on several factors. For example, if a
function/method is part of a time-critical system like one that controls an airplane,
the worst-case times are probably the most important (if the plane is flying towards
a mountain and the controlling program can't make the next course correction until
it has performed a computation, then the best-case and average-case times for that
computation are not relevant -- the computation needs to be guaranteed to be fast
enough to finish before the plane hits the mountain).

On the other hand, if occasionally waiting a long time for an answer is merely
inconvenient (as opposed to life-threatening), it may be better to use an algorithm
with a slow worst-case time and a fast average-case time, rather than one with so-so times in both the average and worst cases.

Note that calculating the average-case time for a function/method can be tricky.
You need to consider all possible values for the important factors, and whether
they will be distributed evenly.

### When do Constants Matter?

Recall that when we use big-O notation, we drop constants and low-order terms.
This is because when the problem size gets sufficiently large, those terms don't
matter. However, this means that two algorithms can have the same big-O time
complexity, even though one is always faster than the other. For example, suppose
algorithm 1 requires N" time, and algorithm 2 requires 10 \* N" + N time. For both
algorithms, the time is O(N"), but algorithm 1 will always be faster than algorithm 2. In this case, the constants and low-order terms do matter in terms of which
algorithm is actually faster.

However, it is important to note that constants do not matter in terms of the
question of how an algorithm "scales" (i.e., how does the algorithm's time change
when the problem size doubles). Although an algorithm that requires N" time will
always be faster than an algorithm that requires 10\*N" time, for both algorithms,
if the problem size doubles, the actual time will quadruple.

When two algorithms have different big-O time complexity, the constants and low-order terms only matter when the problem size is small. For example, even if there
are large constants involved, a linear-time algorithm will always eventually be
faster than a quadratic-time algorithm. This is illustrated in the following table,
which shows the value of 100*N (a time that is linear in N) and the value of N"/100
(a time that is quadratic in N) for some values of N. For values of N less than 104,
the quadratic time is smaller than the linear time. However, for all values of N
greater than 104, the linear time is smaller.
|N|100*N|N^2/100|
|----|----|----|
|10^2| 10^4| 10^2|
|10^3| 10^5| 10^4|
|10^4| 10^6| 10^6|
|10^5| 10^7| 10^8|
|10^6| 10^8| 10^10|
|10^7| 10^9| 10^12|
