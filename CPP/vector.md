# vectors in c++

## Introduction

Vectors are very similar to dynamic arrays for which we don’t have to determine the
size as done in case of arrays.

Vectors are sequence containers representing arrays that can change in size.

They can be used in the same way as the arrays and use the contiguous storage
locations for storing data as in case of arrays. Just the difference is that these
containers can change their size as per the requirements.

Dynamic implementation of arrays is used by vectors to store the elements with
some initial size. In case of arrays, we need to reallocate the memory and then copy
back these elements which is a time-expensive task. This is easily avoidable in case
of vectors as these directly allocates some extra storage to accommodate the
elements. There is a possibility that a vector's capacity is more than the number of
elements present in it as it increases it’s space using square function.

This is achieved by amortized constant time complexity which is internally achieved
in C++.

### Syntax for vector declaration:

```c
vector<data_type> vector_name;
```

### For example: To declare a vector of integer with a name v:

```c
vector<int> v;
```

### To dynamically allocate the same:

```c
vector<int> *v = new vector<int>(); //Header file used is :​ #include <vector>
```

### Some important functions of vector:

```c
push_back           Add element at the end
pop_back            Delete last element
insert              Insert elements
size                Return size
capacity            Return size of allocated storage capacity
```

### Practice to implement a vector in C++

Statement: Perform the following tasks:

1. Create a vector of integer.
2. Insert the elements from 1 to 10 and print size along with capacity at each
   step.

#### Solution Code:

```c
vector<int> *v = new vector<int>();
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
int main() {
vector<int> v; // Part 1
for(int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) { // Part 2
cout << v.capacity() << “ “ << v.size() << endl;
v.push_back(i);
}
return 0;
}
```

#### Output:

```c
0 0
1 1
2 2
4 3
4 4
8 5
8 6
8 7
8 8
16 9
```

#### Observation:

You can see that capacity doubles each time as the vector gets an extra element.
But size represents the total number of elements present in the vector irrespective
of its capacity.
